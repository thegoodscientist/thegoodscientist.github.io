							<h1 class="major">About Me</h1>
                            <h2>Background</h2>
							<p>I am a research data analyst with a strong foundation in market research, AI, data analysis, and business analysis, focused on transforming complex data into actionable insights that help with strategic planning and decision-making.
                                My background combines scientific research, computer science, and applied analytics, allowing me to approach problems with both analytical rigor and practical business context. 
                                My approach includes qualitative and quantitative methods, leveraging tools such as Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI to identify trends and risks, and communicate findings clearly to technical and non-technical 
                                stakeholders.</p>
							<p>During my professional work experience I worked on projects that involved data collection, statistical analysis, research, and technical reporting. 
                                I have contributed to AI-related research initiatives, including predictive diagnostics and patent registration of innovative technologies, where accuracy, documentation, and evidence-based reasoning were critical. 
                                I am also skilled at working with raw data, designing structured approaches to analysis and translating results into clear narratives that support organizational goals.</p>

                            <h2>Volunteer Work</h2>
                            <p>In addition to my professional work, I volunteer as a <b>Publishing Associate (Researcher and Writer)</b> with <a href="https://www.savethewater.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Save the Water™</a>, where I research and write evidence-based articles on water contamination, water technologies, and global water issues. 
                                This role requires sourcing and evaluating credible scientific and policy literature, adhering to strict citation and SEO guidelines, collaborating with editorial leadership, and meeting consistent publication deadlines. 
                                Through this work, I contribute to public-facing research that supports environmental awareness, education, and advocacy.</p>
                            <p>As a <b>Board Member</b> at the <a href="https://ottawa-outaouais.iiba.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA®) Ottawa-Outaouais Chapter</a>, I ensure strong governance, transparency, and continuity of operations. 
                                In this role, I manage and maintain all official corporate documentation, including Letters Patent, Bylaws, and Board meeting records, and oversee the preparation, notification, and distribution of agendas and minutes for both Board and General Membership meetings. 
                                I support organizational accountability by managing meeting logistics, maintaining accurate records of decisions and actions, and facilitating formal communications with the IIBA. 
                                Where required, I also act as a signing authority for financial matters. This role has strengthened my expertise in governance, documentation, and stakeholder coordination, reinforcing my ability to support 
                                structured decision-making in complex, multi-stakeholder environments.</p>
